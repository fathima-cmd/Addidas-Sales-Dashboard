## Addidas Sales Dashboard
This project presents an interactive sales performance dashboard for Adidas, focused on the year 2021.
Designed with a data storytelling approach, the dashboard consolidates a wide range of business-critical metrics including total revenue, operating profit, year-over-year growth, and profit margins. 
It dives deeper into performance breakdowns across sales channels (in-store, online, and outlet), regional markets (top-performing U.S. states), and key retail partners such as Foot Locker, Sports Direct, and Amazon.
